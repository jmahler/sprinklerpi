\section{Information Required for Execution}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this test protocol is to verify the full and complete
operation of the SprinklerPI system.

\subsection{Scope}

This test protocol should be executed to verify that each principal feature
and function performs within specification called out by the engineering
requirements document. In addition, other necessary specifications shall
be tested such as specific and necessary user, installation and power
requirements. The testing called out in this protocol is subject exclusively
to those selected specifications provided for the SprinklerPI.

\subsection{Responsibilities}

It is the responsibility of the assigned test engineer to execute all tests
included herein to the best of their ability. If necessary, seek additional
assistance to execute tasks.

\subsection{References}

Not applicable at this time.

%\subsection{Definitions}

\subsection{Equipment/Supplies}

\begin{itemize}
\item 110 volts AC power supply.
\item Digital volt meter.
\item Three test bridges (25 $\Omega$, 50 watt).
\item Ethernet network connection.
\item (optional) Wireless usb adapter.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Precautions \& Warnings}

This test plan contains certain warnings, cautions and important
notes that the test engineer must be aware of while performing these tests.
The following illustrates each of these messages and how to recognize them.

\fbox{
\textbf{WARNING: \textless message\textgreater}
}

The ``WARNING: Message'' alerts the user about safety issues that are of
the highest importance, such as possible injury to the operator.

\fbox{
\textbf{CAUTION: \textless message\textgreater}
}

The ``CAUTION: Message'' alerts the user to issues concerning possible
damage to the equipment or that can lead to erroneous test results.

\fbox{
\textbf{IMPORTANT: \textless message\textgreater}
}

The ``IMPORTANT: Message'' alerts the user to important design changes.

% {{{ Testing Features and Functions
\section{Testing Features and Functions}

This testing procedure can be used to determine if the system
is fully functional and operating within acceptable tolerances.

This is a minimal set of tests done at a high level of abstraction.
Low level sub-tests which provide no useful increase in the test scope
are not included.
In the event that a fault is found it is left up to an engineer to
determine the root cause.

Several assumptions are made in this test procedure.
It is assumed that networking has already been configured as
described in Appendix \ref{app:networking}.
It is also assumed that a fully populated SprinklerPI system with
three control/drivers is being tested.
This system is modular and the number of control/drivers can vary
from one to three.
Adapting these procedures to a reduced number of control/drivers should
be straightforward but this reduces the scope of the tests.

% {{{ Power On Test
\subsection{Power On Test}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Equipment Required
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 110 volts AC power outlet (NEMA 5-15R).
	\end{itemize}
\item Input
	\begin{itemize}
	\item (none)
	\end{itemize}
\item Output
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Green power LED on.
	\item Activity LEDs during boot up.
	\item Control LEDs off.
	\end{itemize}
\item Test Description \\

During power up the system should be seen going through several states
which can be seen by observing LED indicators (Figure \ref{fig:ledind}).
When it is complete it should end in a specific state.

After plugging the cord in to a 110 volt AC outlet the green LED on
the power supply should go on.
Then, as the computer boots up, activity should be seen on its LEDs.
The control LEDs may go on/off randomly as the system boots.
They also may may turn on valve number one during boot.
This is normal as the output pins go through random states and
is eventually cleared.
After approximately 30 seconds the activity LEDs on the computer
should reduce which indicates that the system has completed booting.
At this point all control/driver LEDs should be off.

\subsection{Manual Control Test}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Equipment Required
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 110 volts AC power outlet (NEMA 5-15R).
	\item PC with Internet access and a web browser.
	\end{itemize}
\item Input
	\begin{itemize}
	\item User turns valves on using manual mode of web interface.
	\end{itemize}
\item Output
	\begin{itemize}
	\item LED indicator for each valve which is turned on.
	\end{itemize}
\item Test Description \\

These tests verify that the valves can be manually operated from
the web interface (Figure \ref{fig:www-manual_mode}).
The user iterates through each possible combination and verifies
that the LED valve indicator is correct.

(Appendix \ref{app:networking}) and that the URL of the server being
used for testing is known.

\item Test Description \\

The 110 volt to 24 volt AC power adapter should be connected to the
two pin input header (Figure \ref{fig:psm2}, top left) and screwed down.
With the power adapter plugged in to a 110 volts AC power supply the
green power LED should come on.
Using a DMM to measure voltage, there should be 3.3 volts DC output on
the ``5V'' header pins and 24 volts AC output on the ``24 VAC'' header pins.
Be sure to switch from AC to DC modes on the DMM as necessary.
The polarity of DC voltages are denoted on the PCB (Figure \ref{fig:psm2}).
