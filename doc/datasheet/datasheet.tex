{\large \textbf{Description}}

A web based sprinkler control system similar to commercial offerings
but which is far more customizable.
Very detailed watering schedules can be created with no arbitrary limit
on size or complexity.
It is internet accessible even when installed behind a firewall or on
a private network.
The hardware is modular allowing from 1 to 24 sprinkler valves to be controlled.
The software is modular which makes customization and expansion simple.
It runs Linux using a Rasberry PI to provide the web interface and
run the scheduling daemons.
All the hardware and software is open source and licensed under the GPL.
