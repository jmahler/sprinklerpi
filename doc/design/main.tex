\section{Architectural Design}

There are three main components in this architecture:
the power supply, the RasberryPI Linux computer, and the Control Driver.
See Figure \ref{fig:archoview} for a diagram.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{xcircuit/architecture_overview}
\end{center}
\caption{System architecture overview with one control/driver.
Additional control/drivers can be added up to a maximum of three.
Expansion is limited by the power supply.}
\label{fig:archoview}
\end{figure}

The power supply must take an input of 110 volts AC.
This is the standard residential voltage found in the U.S.
It must provide 24 volts AC to drive the sprinkler valves.
And it must provide 5 volts DC to power the RasberryPI as well
as the logic in the Control Driver.

The RasberryPI Linux computer is a standard version B model.
It communicates to the Control Driver using SPI.
User access is provided either through the Ethernet interface
or through the USB interface with a wireless adapter.
It is powered from a 5 volt DC source.

The Control Driver controls a group of eight sprinkler valves.
It takes commands over SPI.
It requires a 25 volt AC source to power the sprinkler valves.
And it requires a 5 volt DC source to power the internal logic.

The Control Driver also provides a SPI MOSI output so that more
than one Control Driver can be daisy chained to support more
sprinkler valves.  Currently the limiting factor for expansion is
the power supply.

% {{{ State Flow Diagrams
\subsection{State Flow Diagrams}

Figure \ref{fig:hwstate} shows the state machine of the
control circuitry in hardware.

The system is always either driving one of the eight valves
or has all of the valves off.
The only time this changes is when a new command is sent.

During power on all the valves must remain in the off state.
If this were not required, and the system entered some random
state during power on, a valve could inadvertently be turned on.
And this valve would not be turned off until the next
command was received.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{dia/hardware_state}
\caption{State diagram of hardware control circuitry.
During power on it is important that the valves remain off.
In the idle state it waits for a command to turn on a valve or
turn off all valves.}\label{fig:hwstate}
\end{figure}

The hardware state is determined by the control circuitry
(Section \ref{sec:control}).

% {{{ Control
\subsubsection{Control}
\label{sec:control}

Before the sprinkler valve can be driven, some control logic is necessary
between the RasberryPI and the driver (Section \ref{sec:driver}).
Most residential sprinkler systems are capable of driving eight circuits.
And only one of these circuits is active at any one time
\footnote{If multiple circuits were active this could lower the
water pressure resulting in inconsistent watering amounts.}.
This controller uses the same design
\footnote{With some minor redesign this controller could be
expanded to control a large number of circuits possibly
with multiple active circuits at a time.}.

The RasberryPI has enough GPIO pins to control each valve independently.
But doing this would be a waste.
Future expansion to a large number of circuits would be severely limited.
And the time requirements are very generous.
Being able to switch a valve every second is more than adequate.

Instead of using individual GPIO pins, the four SPI pins provided by
the SPI are used.
This design sends 8-bits for each message (Figure \ref{fig:spi}).
But only three bits are used to address each valve ($2^3 = 8$).
If the design was expanded to use the available bits
it could address 128 valves ($2^7 = 128$).
The single enable bit was chosen to simplify the circuitry.
However it does reduce the maximum number of addresses by one bit.

}

Going from SPI to signals which can turn on/off a valve requires
more logic than has been discussed so far.
A shift register is needed to take the bits as inputs.
A decoder is needed to convert shifted in number to a single
bit output.
In this case a 74HC238 3-8 decoder is used since it provides non-inverting
inputs suitable from the drivers (Section \ref{sec:driver}).
An output high will turn on a valve.
Figure \ref{fig:control} shows the control schematic.

\begin{figure}[hbp]
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{xcircuit/control}
\caption{Sprinkler valve control logic.
Sprinkler valve number is input using SPI from the RasberryPI in
to the shift register.  The number is decoded and inverted to produce
a single high signal for one valve.
All outputs are disabled when OA is clear.}\label{fig:control}
\end{figure}

On power up it is important that the valves remain off.
However the shift register chip (74HC194) does not guarantee
the output state during power up.
To resolve this issue a simple RC circuit is used to to hold the
chip in the clear state for several seconds after power
on (Figure \ref{fig:control}).

% {{{ Driver
\subsubsection{Driver}
\label{sec:driver}

\begin{figure}[hbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{xcircuit/driver_mult}
\caption{Sprinkler valve driver circuits.  For brevity not
all drivers are shown since they all have identical designs.
LEDs are used to indicate when the valve is on/off.
This design assumes that only one valve will be one at a time.
}\label{fig:driver}
\end{figure}

To turn the sprinkler valves on requires 24 VAC at approximately 270 mA.
If it is assumed that during steady state both the solenoid
and the triac have negligible resistance (Figure \ref{fig:driver}),
a 10 $\Omega$ resistor can be used to limit the current to 240 mA.
At 1 watt the resistor supports the worst case amperage with a margin
over 10\%.

\begin{align*}
	P &= I^2 R \\
	  &= (270\e{-3})^2 \cdot 10 \\
	  &= 0.729 \quad \text{[W]}
\end{align*}

The control signal to the triac (Q401E4) is very sensitive.
The tinyest current will cause it to conduct.
If it is driven by a 0-5V signal it will conduct not only
with a 5V signal but also with 0V signal.
To overcome this issue a diode was used to ensure no current
flows when it is reverse biased.
The FET (2N7000) is used to switch the triac while it also
serves to limit the control current of a 0-5 volt signal
to less than 0.5 mA.
This places the control current well within the limits
of CMOS logic as required by the control chips (Section \ref{sec:control}).

% }}}

% {{{ Power Supply
\subsubsection{Power Supply}
\label{sec:power}

The power supply must provide two different voltages: 24 volts AC and
5 volts DC.
The sprinkler valves require 24 volts AC at 270 mA.
The RasberryPI and other digital logic require 5 volts DC with a
maximum draw of 600 mA
\footnote{The current draw of the RasberryPI was determined
experimentally to be approximately 500 mA.}.
These voltages must be created from a 110 volt AC input.

The 24 volts AC can be achieved using a split pole transformer
with two 12 volt AC outputs.
By bridging the center of these two 12 volt AC outputs
a combined 24 volt AC output is available.

A switching voltage regulator, the MC34063A, was chosen for
the 5 volt supply.
It has a greater efficiency than a linear regulator such as
the LM7805.

The circuit which achieves all of these design requirements is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:power}.

\subsection{Theory of Operation}

% describe external interface

The primary controller is the ARM STM32F4.
It interfaces directly with all the sensors and actuators necessary to
operate the engine.
It runs in real time and does not interact directly with the user.

The secondary controller is the RasberryPI.
It communicates with the primary controller over SPI.
Through this communication channel all the settings on the STM32F4 can
be configured.

The secondary controller (RasberryPI) also acts as the primary user interface.
All configuration options are accessed using dynamic files.
When the files are modified the changes will be automatically propigated
to the controller.
And when the controller has new information the files are automatically
updated.

% {{{ Future Directions
\section{Future Directions}

\subsection{Automated Hardware Testing}

Currently the operation of the system can be manually
verified by a user.  There are LED indicators to show
when a valve is on/off.  And programs can be written
to operate all the valves.
It can also be verified by a user that the sprinkler
valves operate when connected to an actual sprinkler
system.
However this process is far too slow and costly for
testing this system if it was manufactured.

One solution is to create an additional module which
can place a load on the driver circuit for each of
the eight valves.
And by measuring the voltage/current it can be determined
if the correct circuit is being actuated and if
its rated current is being drawn.

And programs can be written to control the system and
verify its operation using this test module.
The entire system could be tested and verified in a
few minutes.

% TODO - diagram of test module

\subsection{i2c Bus}

The SPI bus will become cumbersome to use with many
controllers.
In a daisy chain configuration each controller requires
eight bits.
As an example, with ten controllers an eighty bit command
would have to be sent.

A more capable bus such as i2c or CAN might be a good alternative.
