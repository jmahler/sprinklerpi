sprinklerpi - Sprinkler control with Linux using a RasberryPI

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The task of watering a lawn is conceptually simple.
Turn on certain sprinklers at certain times and run them for
a certain duration.

The well known UNIX/Linux program `cron` can run any program
on any schedule: every day, every other day, every third Friday,
every day during the month of august.  The possible combinations
are endless.

Using the power of `cron` on a [RasberryPI][rpi] running Linux with
a small amount interface hardware to control the sprinkler
valves and the result is a very powerful sprinkler control system.
